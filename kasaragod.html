                  <p class="card-text text-left">Ananthapura Lake Temple is a serene Hindu temple built in the middle of a lake located in Village Ananthapura, Kasargod. It is a holy temple of Ananthapadmanabhan Swami. It is believed that Ananthapadmanabhan settled down here first and then moved to Thiruvananthapuram through a cave which lies to the right-hand side corner of the lake. The cave is said to be a natural structure that separates Ananthapura and Thiruvananthapuram and therefore, these two temples retain the name of the same deity.

                    The Ananthapura Lake Temple is a perfect example of nature living in total harmony with each other, and it indeed is, as it is seen by the presence of a crocodile in spite of humans visiting the temple to offer their prayers.</p>

                  <p class="card-text text-left">Nileshwaram, also known by the name of Nileshwar, is a major town that is located in the Kasaragod District of Kerala in southern India. Nileshwaram is one of the three municipalities that can be found in the district, the others being Kasaragod and Kanhangad. Nileshwaram is also referred to as the cultural capital of the Kasargod District and lies nestled between two rivers, the Nileshwaram Puzha and Thejaswini Puzha. With the Arabian Sea to its west, the town is breathtakingly beautiful and a spectacular site to be at.

                    The name Nileshwaram comes from one of the names of Lord Shiva, Neelakanteshwaran, which means the Blue-necked One. The name denotes that Nileshwaram is a land of Lord Shiva. Another story that is related to the name of the place is of Sage Neela, who mounted the deity of Lord Siva thousands of years ago.</p>

                    <p class="card-text text-left">The gentle hills of Ranipuram in Kerala are famous for its trekking trail. Situated at the height of about 750 meters above sea level, this destination has thick forest vegetation and lush green grasslands. The whole place is proposed inside the Ranipuram Wildlife Sanctuary which merges with Talakaveri Wildlife Sanctuary of Karnataka.

                      The sublime beauty of this region is comparable to that of Ooty, and is a must-visit for all nature enthusiasts. The innocent life of the village and gentle nature make a perfect blend of delight and enjoyment. The entire trek route of Ranipuram is very scenic and a  delight for nature photographers. The trek lasts for about two and a half kilometres, and the summit has a cave, and reaching it is quite an adventurous experience.</p>

                    <p class="card-text text-left">Cheruvathur is a cosy small town in the Kasaragod district of Kerala, located only 10 kilometres south of the major town of Nileshwaram. The place is known for being the birthplace of great 19th-century poet Mahakavi Kuttamath of Kerala. His work on musical drama and poem compilations is an excellent source of literary inspiration in Cheruvathur. Keeping that in mind, authorities changed the name of the town to Kuttamath Nagar on paper. However, most people still call the town Cheruvathur only.

                      The etymology of the name has its origin in the Malayalam words "cheriya pathu ooru" which means ten small places. Cheruvathur mainly attracts tourists because of its lovely views and greeneries. But more than that, it is a peaceful suburban retreat for a short weekend trip.
