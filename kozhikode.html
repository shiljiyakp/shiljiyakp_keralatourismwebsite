                        <p class="card-text text-left">Located on the northern side of the scenic state of Kerala, Kozhikode has always been a popular destination for its backwaters. These backwaters are a distinctive feature of this area and have been generously blessed with abundant natural beauty, dense greenery and exotic flora and fauna. The palm-fringed rivulets, lakes and canals of Kozhikode are decked with engaging beauty. The calm of these undisturbed waters is contagious and instils within you a feeling of tranquil peace and serenity. Unlike most rivers that flow towards the direction of the seas and oceans, backwaters are a part of the river that has little or no current.
